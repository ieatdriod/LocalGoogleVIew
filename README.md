Several months ago,our website uploaded sphere photos of our customer's house to Google Views, 

and display all the photos by embeding a frame(with pano id) on web page.

But everything changed. Google shuted down the "Classic Views" and introduced "lite" version(doesn't work for us).
Now we're not able to upload photos any more! What a "Good" News.  

Fortunately, we founded a solution which customize the panoroma display offered by Google.
It's easy to display and edit sphere photos pov for our site, and upload photos to our own cdn server now.

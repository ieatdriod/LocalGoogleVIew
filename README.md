Wanna display sphere photos on your website? This is the solution you should try.

Our website uploaded sphere photos of our customer's house to Google Views, 

and we embeded a iframe(with pano id) on web page to display those photos.

But everything changed. Google shuted down the "Classic Views" and intriduced "lite" version,

now we'll not able to upload photos any more! What a "good" New.  

Fortunately, we founded a solution to display sphere photos on our web without upload to google now.

You can download all the sample code and images, and I think you can change the images easily.

Have Fun!

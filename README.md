Wanna display sphere photos on your website? This is the solution you should try.

Our website uploaded sphere photos of our customer's house to Google Views, 

and we embeded a iframe(with pano id) on web page to display those photos. 

#Have a look when we can upload to google

But everything changed. Google shuted down the "Classic Views" and intriduced "lite" version,

now we'll not able to upload photos any more! What a "good" New.  

Fortunately, we founded a solution to display sphere photos on our web without upload to google now.

#Now check what we've done

You can download all the sample code and images, and I think you can change the images easily.

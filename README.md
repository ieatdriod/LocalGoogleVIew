Wanna display sphere photos on your website? This is the solution you should try.

Our website uploaded sphere photos of our customer's house to Google Views, 

and we embeded a iframe(with pano id) on web page to display those photos. 

#Have a look when we can upload to google

But everything changed. Google shuted down the "Classic Views" and intriduced "lite" version,
now we'll not able to upload photos any more! What a "Good" News.  

Fortunately, we founded a solution.
It's easy to display and edit sphere photos pov for our site, and upload photos to oue own cdn server now.

#Now check what we've done

You can download all the sample code and images, and I think you can change the images easily.
